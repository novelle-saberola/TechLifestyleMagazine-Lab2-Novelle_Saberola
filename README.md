#Tech & Lifestyle Weekly Magazine - Lab 2
**Name:** Novelle V. Saberola
**Student ID:** 2024300628
**Design Choices:**

-In the contact section I added, I used #eef6fb – a soft, light blue to create a calm and friendly appearance.
    -For text's colors, I chose the dark colors for more readability and clarity.
    -For the body text's font, i chose "Times New Roman, Serif" for classic and elegant looking.
    -Font sizes are increased (1.1rem for body, 2.2rem for heading) for easy scanning.
    -The .contact-section is centered and constrained to a max-width: 500px to maintain focus.
    -Text-align: center ensures a clean, symmetrical appearance on most screen sizes.
    -Rounded corners (border-radius: 10px) and box shadows give the section a soft, elevated feel.
    -Consistent spacing between paragraphs, links, and social icons supports readability.
    -The bonus feature here is the animation. On hover, the .contact-section smoothly increases its shadow for a subtle animated feedback effect.
-I also added an icon which is the scorpion emoji because i just feel like adding it hehe.
- This project implements a clean, responsive web layout using modern CSS techniques, with a focus on clear structure and interactivity.
-Typography: 
    Imported Google Fonts – Playfair Display for headings; default serif for body.
Colors & Gradients: 
    Deep blues (#036, #024), soft blues (#5dade2, #9ac2e5), and light backgrounds for readability and calm aesthetics.
-Layout:
    Flexbox used in navigation (nav ul), article layout (.articles), and newsletter form.
-Responsive design using media queries to stack content on smaller screens.
-Hero Section: Includes a background image (images/hero-bg (2).jpg) with a dark overlay using ::before.
